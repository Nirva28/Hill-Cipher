# Hill Cipher Encryption and Decryption (for 3√ó3 matrix)
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Hill Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm.

The Hill Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra that operates on blocks of letters at a time, each letter represented by a number modulo 26, and using a key matrix of size n√ón.
In this implementation, a 3√ó3 key matrix is used, which means the plaintext is processed in blocks of 3 letters. The implementation is done purely in Python, without relying on external libraries for matrix calculations.

## üìñ Introduction
This code was developed as part of a college project to gain a deeper understanding of:
- Matrix operations (multiplication, determinant, adjoint, inverse)

- Modular arithmetic (mod 26 for the alphabet)

- Classical cryptography techniques
  
The objective was to implement the Hill Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm from scratch, without using external libraries or predefined matrix functions.

Through this project, I explored the fundamental concepts behind the Hill Cipher and gained practical experience in combining mathematics with cryptography in Python.

## üõ† How does the program work?
### 1.Key Matrix Creation
- The key string (length 9 or padded) is converted into numbers (a=0, b=1, ..., z=25).

- These numbers are reshaped into a 3√ó3 key matrix.

### 2.Encryption
- The plaintext is split into blocks of 3.

- Each block is multiplied by the key matrix under modulo 26.

- The resulting numbers are converted back to letters to form ciphertext.

### 3.Decryption
- The determinant of the key matrix is computed modulo 26.

- Its multiplicative inverse is found.

- Using the adjoint and inverse determinant, the inverse matrix is built.

- Ciphertext blocks are multiplied with the inverse matrix modulo 26 to recover the original plaintext.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
### 1.Run the Program
``` python3 hill_cipher.py ```

Once it runs, it will present a menu with the following options:

1.Encrypt a message ‚Äì Enter plaintext and a key to generate ciphertext.

2.Decrypt a message ‚Äì Enter ciphertext and the same key to recover plaintext.

3.Exit ‚Äì Quit the program.
