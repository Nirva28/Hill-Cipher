# Hill Cipher Encryption and Decryption (for 3Ã—3 matrix)
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Hill Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm.

The Hill Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra that operates on blocks of letters at a time, each letter represented by a number modulo 26, and using a key matrix of size nÃ—n.
In this implementation, a 3Ã—3 key matrix is used, which means the plaintext is processed in blocks of 3 letters. The implementation is done purely in Python, without relying on external libraries for matrix calculations.

#ðŸ“– Introduction
This code was developed as part of a college project to gain a deeper understanding of:
Matrix operations (multiplication, determinant, adjoint, inverse)

Modular arithmetic (mod 26 for the alphabet)

Classical cryptography techniques
The objective was to implement the Hill Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm from scratch, without using external libraries or predefined matrix functions.

Through this project, I explored the fundamental concepts behind the Hill Cipher and gained practical experience in combining mathematics with cryptography in Python.
